        <h1>Zhengyang Kris Weng</h1>
        <p>I'm a versatile engineer with heavy interest in medical and surgical robots. A team player with strong analytical and problem solving skills, I thrive in cross functional teams to leverage solid mechanical design and prototyping expertise to find creative solutions to engineering challenges.</p>
        <p>My passion lies in robotic system development, with solid experiences spanning across mechanical, electrical, system integration and design. Throughout the years working in robotics R&D, I have acquired a skillset suited for turning product design inputs into engineering results. I'm looking forward to pushing the boundaries of robot-assisted surgery and transform the future of healthcare.</p>

                    <p>As a senior mechanical engineer currently working at J&J, I am mainly responsible for system design on the Monarch Surgical Platform, the first robotic platform for minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the lungs and kidneys.</p>
                    <p>I work on many projects related to the robotic arm and instrument manipulator, both on the hardware and software front. I'm not able to disclose too many details on these projects at this moment, but I will be glad to share my experience when the legal effect expires.</p>
